Dengue Patient Analysis Project
This project provides an analysis of dengue patient data to understand the distribution and characteristics of dengue-positive cases based on demographic and clinical factors. The analysis includes feature importance, age distribution, gender distribution, symptom frequency, and other relevant insights to help identify key factors and affected groups.

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to gain insights into dengue fever cases by analyzing a medical dataset with features such as age, gender, residence area, symptoms, and test results. Key tasks in the analysis include:

Calculating the frequency and percentage of symptoms among dengue-positive cases.
Identifying the most affected age groups and gender distribution for confirmed dengue cases.
Calculating feature importance using machine learning models.
Visualizing distributions and key characteristics to better understand the demographics of dengue.
